NAME
    POE::Component::Captcha::reCAPTCHA - A POE implementation of the
    reCAPTCHA API

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
    POE::Component::Captcha::reCAPTCHA is a POE implementation of
    Captcha::reCAPTCHA. It provides access to various Captcha::reCAPTCHA
    methods and a non-blocking mechanism for checking the answer provided by
    users.

CONSTRUCTOR
    "spawn"
        Creates a new POE::Component::Captcha::reCAPTCHA session.

        Returns an object reference which the following methods can be used
        on.

METHODS
    "session_id"
        Takes no arguments. Returns the POE::Session ID of the component.

    "shutdown"
        Takes no arguments. Terminates the component.

    "check_answer"
        After the user has filled out the HTML form, including their answer
        for the CAPTCHA, use "check_answer" to check their answer when they
        submit the form. The user's answer will be in two form fields,
        "recaptcha_challenge_field" and "recaptcha_response_field". The
        component will make an HTTP request to the reCAPTCHA server and
        verify the user's answer.

        Requires a "HASHREF" as an argument with the following keys, all of
        which are required:

        "event"
            The name of the "event" that should be sent to the requesting
            session with the reply from the reCAPTCHA server.

        "privatekey"
            Your reCAPTCHA private key, from the API Signup Page.

        "remoteip"
            The user's IP address, in the format 192.168.0.1.

        "challenge"
            The value of the form field recaptcha_challenge_field

        "response"
            The value of the form field recaptcha_response_field.

        See "OUTPUT EVENTS" below for what will be sent to your session in
        reply.

    These methods are directly equivalent to their Captcha::reCAPTCHA
    counterparts. ( in fact they merely map to an instance of
    Captcha::reCAPTCHA that the component creates internally ). See
    Captcha::reCAPTCHA for more details.

    "get_html"
        Generates HTML to display the captcha.

    "get_options_setter"
        Enables customisation of look of the reCAPTCHA widget with some
        JavaScript settings.

INPUT EVENTS
    These are POE events that the component will accept.

    "shutdown"
        Takes no arguments. Terminates the component.

    "check_answer"
        After the user has filled out the HTML form, including their answer
        for the CAPTCHA, use "check_answer" to check their answer when they
        submit the form. The user's answer will be in two form fields,
        "recaptcha_challenge_field" and "recaptcha_response_field". The
        component will make an HTTP request to the reCAPTCHA server and
        verify the user's answer.

        Requires a "HASHREF" as an argument with the following keys, all of
        which are required:

        "event"
            The name of the "event" that should be sent to the requesting
            session with the reply from the reCAPTCHA server.

        "privatekey"
            Your reCAPTCHA private key, from the API Signup Page.

        "remoteip"
            The user's IP address, in the format 192.168.0.1.

        "challenge"
            The value of the form field recaptcha_challenge_field

        "response"
            The value of the form field recaptcha_response_field.

        See "OUTPUT EVENTS" below for what will be sent to your session in
        reply.

        You may also set arbitary keys to pass arbitary data along with your
        request. These must be prefixed with an underscore "_".

OUTPUT EVENTS
    The component will send an event in response to "check_answer". "ARG0"
    of the event will be a "HASHREF" containing the key/values of the
    original request ( including any arbitary key/values passed ).

    In addition the "is_valid" and "error" keys will indicate the status of
    the request to the reCAPTCHA server:

    "is_valid"
        If this is set to a true value then the request was successful and
        the challenge and response sent were valid.

    "error"
        If this is set then an error occurred.
